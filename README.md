### Intro to Programming Readme File
 This ReadMe was made by Anthony Catalano, an ameteur programming student, for the course Version Control Management (ID# CSCI 1100) at Southwest Technical College, to describe the function of the entire repository. The repository was made to save assignments going forward into the next course, Intro to Programming (ADD COURSE ID HERE LATER)
